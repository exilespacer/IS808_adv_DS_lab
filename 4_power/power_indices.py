## Number of votes necessary to approve initiative.
QUORUM = 10

## Weights of each player.
weights = [ 1, 5, 7, 3 ]

## Index of players (from 0 to N-1)
players = range(N)


# #### Shapley Index
# 
# "The power of a coalition (or a player) is measured by the fraction of the possible voting sequences in which that coalition casts the deciding vote, that is, the vote that first guarantees passage or failure."
# 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapley%E2%80%93Shubik_power_index
# 
# _Note:_ The key word is "sequences".

# **Exercise: Compute the Shapley index for all players.**
# 
# _Note:_ `itertools` is your friend.

# #### Banzhaf Index
# 
# "To calculate the power of a voter using the Banzhaf index, list all the winning coalitions, then count the critical voters. A critical voter is a voter who, if he changed his vote from yes to no, would cause the measure to fail."
# 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banzhaf_power_index

# **Exercise: Compute the Banzhaf index for all players.**

QUORUM = 10

## Here we have both weights and votes.
weights = [ 1, 5, 7, 3 ]
votes = [ 1, 1, 1, -1]

N = len(weights)
players = range(N)

n_infavor = votes.count(1)
n_against = votes.count(-1)
n_abstained = N - n_infavor - n_against

print(n_infavor, n_against, n_abstained)

## Summing total weights in favor (positive) 
## and against (negative).
Wp = 0
Wn = 0

for i in range(N):
    if votes[i] == 1: Wp += weights[i]
    elif votes[i] == -1: Wn += weights[i]

print(Wp, Wn)


# #### Potential Power
# 
# Potential power tests if a weight _i_ is larger than the distance to quorum of all remaining votes:
# 
# It is equal to:
# 
# - 1, if test is positive;
# - 0, if test is negative

# **Exercise: Compute potential power for a given player.**
# 
# _Note_: in the paper they use quorum as a fraction, but you can use it as a count.

# #### Exercised Power
# 
# Exercised power tests if the outcome of a voting is different with and without a player _i_:
# 
# It is equal to:
# 
# - 1, if test is positive (outcomes differ);
# - 0, if test is negative (same outcome)

# **Exercise: Compute exercised power for a given player.**
# 
# _Note_: in the paper they use quorum as a fraction, but you can use it as a count.
